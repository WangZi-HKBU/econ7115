# Econ7115: Structural Models and Numerical Methods in Economics
Zi Wang  
Hong Kong Baptist University  
Spring 2025

The objective of this course is to familiarize students with structural models across various economic fields. Throughout the course, students will acquire a comprehensive understanding of: (i) the fundamental concepts underlying structural modelling, (ii) the state-of-art process of connecting models with empirical data in economics, (iii) methods for identifying and estimating structural models, and (iv) essential numerical techniques required for structural modelling. Additionally, students will practice the Matlab programming language for numerical solutions in structural modeling.
